# TaxConsoleApp

This is a small and kind of useless piece of code I made on a Saturday morning (~2 hrs). It was a nice, fairly easy coding challenge that gave me an opportunity to learn new things as well.

## The Premise

Veronmaksajat.fi had listed the tax percents of different salaries for 2021.
There was a net salary ONLY for the yearly gross salary.
But I wanted to know what the monthly net salary was. Sure, i could've done the math myself for every given salary. But nah.

So what I did was I requested the whole html page that contained the data into my code as a string. Then I just parsed the data and pretty much just divided the yearly net salary by 12. Probably not the most accurate calculation. It was a fun coding excercise though.
